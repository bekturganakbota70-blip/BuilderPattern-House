# Report for Assignment 1 – Builder Pattern

## Product: House

I implemented the Builder Pattern using a `House` class.  
The Builder allows step-by-step construction of different houses (wooden, stone, etc.).

## Clean Code Principles
1. Clear method names (`setWalls`, `setRoof`).
2. Small methods, each doing one thing.
3. Encapsulation: private constructor, only builder can create objects.
4. Readable structure and consistent formatting.

## Example Output
House with wooden walls, tile roof, wood floor, Garage: true, Garden: false  
House with stone walls, concrete roof, marble floor, Garage: false, Garden: true
